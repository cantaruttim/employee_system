[DEVELOPING]

The goal is to develop a web application that allows users to view their current location on a map and record their work hours through the system.

# System
Build in two parts. Front and Backend.

- On front side, we would see a menu where we can specify what we would like to see (Finance Report, CheckIn/CheckOut of an employee). On CheckIn and CheckOut parts we would see where on the map we are right now!

- On the other hand, on the back side, we would see all the business rules of our program.
