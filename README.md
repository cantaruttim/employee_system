[DEVELOPING]

An small aplication that we can see our location on map

# System
Build in two parts. Front and Backend.

- On front side, we would see a menu where we can specify what we would like to see (Finance Report, CheckIn/CheckOut of an employee). On CheckIn and CheckOut parts we would see where on the map we are right now!

- On the other hand, on the back side, we would see all the business rules of our program.
